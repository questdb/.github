QuestDB is a high-performance open source database for time series.
The project is built from scratch in Java and C++, with no dependencies, and is 100% free from garbage collection.
The database is optimized for time series with high-throughput ingestion over InfluxDB Line Protocol and allows users to use SQL as a query language via REST API or PostgreSQL wire.

Our [live demo](https://demo.questdb.io/) includes a 1.6 billion row table with 10 years of NYC taxi trips, 10 years of weather data for joins on the taxi data, and a geospatial data set to try out.
