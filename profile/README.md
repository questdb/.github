## Hi, we're the team behind QuestDB

![Banner with illustration of QuestDB, the open source time series database](/images/org_banner.png)

QuestDB is an open-source database that efficiently stores, accesses and analyzes timestamped data. It is focused on
performance and ease of use with SQL as its querying language and its compatibility with existing tools. QuestDB's software
architecture has been designed from the ground up to operate as close to the hardware as possible - offering superior
performance and lowering hardware requirements.

The codebase is built from scratch in zero-GC Java, C++ and Rust, without code dependencies.

Our [live demo](https://demo.questdb.io/) includes a NYC taxi trips dataset of 1.6 billion rows, market data ingested live from the Coinbase API, and a geospatial dataset.
Our real-time [market data dashboards](https://questdb.io/dashboards/crypto/) and [taxi data dashboards](https://questdb.io/dashboards/taxi/) are powered by QuestDB and Grafana.
