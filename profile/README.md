## Hi üëã, we're the team behind QuestDB

![Banner with illustration of QuestDB, the open source time series database](/images/org_banner.png)

QuestDB is an open-source time-series database for high throughput ingestion and fast SQL queries with operational simplicity. It supports schema-agnostic ingestion using the InfluxDB line protocol, PostgreSQL wire protocol, and a REST API for bulk imports and exports.

The project is built from scratch in zero-GC Java and C++, without code dependencies.

Our [live demo](https://demo.questdb.io/) includes a NYC taxi trips dataset of 1.6 billion rows, market data ingested live from the Coinbase API, and a geospatial dataset.
