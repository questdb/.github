QuestDB is a high-performance, open-source database for time series data. 
It focuses on fast ingest, blazingly fast queries and superior developer experience with SQL and open formats.

QuestDB is designed from the ground up to operate as close to the 
hardware as possible -- eliminating ingestion bottlenecks and lowering overall hardware requirements.

The codebase is built from scratch in zero-GC Java, C++ and Rust.
